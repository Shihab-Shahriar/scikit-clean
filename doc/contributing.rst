==============

Since researchers are the intended audience of this library, we value correctness \
and readability over complex performance optimizations and broad functionality. \
Although note that we reuse scikit-learn's built-in functions whenever we can, \
and that has somewhat different priorities.

We welcome all types of contributions: correcting bugs in code, typos in \
documentation or implementation of new algorithms. Our inclusion criteria for new \
algorithm is pretty relaxed- any algorithm that has been published in a peer-reviewed \
journal/conference is eligible. Please view this guideline_ from scikit-learn before \
you open a pull request.
